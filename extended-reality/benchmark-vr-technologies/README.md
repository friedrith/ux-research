# Benchmark VR technologies

## Web technologies

I am a big fan of web technologies so I naturally chose to begin to benchmark web technologies for
virtual reality.


### AFrame.io

* :+1: seems to be very easy to code
* :information_source: need to activate in in [chrome://flags](chrome://flags)
* :+1: online examples work
* :+1: offline examples work
* fluid
* seems compatible with a lot of headsets and with AR.js

* [A-frame](https://aframe.io/)
* [HUD](https://github.com/pookage/aframe-hud)

### WebVR

* :+1: Examples work
* :information_source: need to install VR addons on chrome on Android (very easy to install since it is available on
  google play).
* :warning: even if the website propose examples, it is only a specification and not an implementation

* [Documentation](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/)
* [Implementation for cardboard](https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display)

### React VR

* integrated to react :heart:
* very slow to compile
* lag
