# Benchmark VR technologies

## Web technologies

I am a big fan of web technologies so I naturally chose to begin to benchmark web technologies for
virtual reality.

### AFrame.io

- :+1: seems to be very easy to code
- :information_source: need to activate in in [chrome://flags](chrome://flags)
- :+1: online examples work
- :+1: offline examples work
- fluid
- seems compatible with a lot of headsets and with AR.js

- [HUD](https://github.com/pookage/aframe-hud)

### WebVR

- :+1: Examples work
- :information_source: need to install VR addons on chrome on Android (very easy to install since it is available on
  google play).
- :warning: even if the website propose examples, it is only a specification and not an implementation

- [Documentation](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/)
- [Implementation for cardboard](https://github.com/immersive-web/cardboard-vr-display)

### React VR

- integrated to react :heart:
- very slow to compile
- lag
