In virtual reality, there is the term **reality**. It means that it is built to explore a reality, a world
in **three dimensions**. So we need to check if virtual reality is really more efficient than the best
current user interfaces to explore 3D worlds: flat screens and current reality.

## Virtual reality vs flat screens

First of all, we can compare virtual reality with flat screens. Exploring 3D worlds with 2D screens at
the first person may seem awkward but it is very popular in video gaming since 80s with first person
shooter games like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).

A lot of competitive games (CS-GO, Call of Duty) are now available and so users have been more and
more efficient to explore 3D worlds with a flat screens. So using a flat screen stay relevant even
to explore a world in three dimensions. After a first look, we can find three reasons why VR might
be more efficient than current 2D screens.

The first reason is the **angle of vision**. Since the reality virtual is supposed to reproduce
the user vision, it should have a peripheral vision than 2D screens. And with a better angle of
vision, virtual reality should help user to see things around him.

The second reason is the **non hand-eye coordination**. With video games displayed in flat screens
you always have the direction of the hand synchronized with the direction of yours eyes. It means that
you cannot interact with something which is not in your angle of vision. It is not very significant in
video games because the game play is adapted to this constraint. However it might be more problematic
in some other use cases.

The third reason is more anecdotal. It is the **similarity of movements between virtual reality and
reality**. In flat screens, the movements of the head is controlled by the mouse, joysticks and keyboard.
It may be very accurate for trained people. However it may also be disturbing for non aware users.
In this case, virtual reality may be easier to use for these non aware users.

In conclusion VR is more **immersive** than 2D screens. This is surely a good point for video games.
But is it also the case for productivity at work in daily life? Not sure. This immersion clears out
of touch with reality. If a colleague wants to talk to you, he can't.

For all these reasons, we need to find something more innovative than use cases manageable with flat
screens.

> In the future, maybe I will try to find use cases where virtual reality might be more useful than
2D screens and try to validate the benefits of the VR.

## Virtual reality vs ... reality

Then we need to compare the VR with exploring the real world. Because some games began to use VR
without questioning the real usability in comparison of real life like [Catan](https://www.catan.com/game/catan-vr).

The first reason that could give more points to virtual reality than reality is obviously the virtuality.
It allows the user to travel in an imaginary world and maybe with more power than in reality.

A second reason is to be able to enhance the vision of the user thanks to a HUD.

A third reason is to get a controllable environment. This is very useful for training for example. You
can change the context, script actions, whatever you want to male the environment reproductible.
