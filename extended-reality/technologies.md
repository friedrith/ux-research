# Extended Reality technologies

This list tries to centralize all piece of information about AR/VR/MR technologies.

You can find hardware products official websites but also api, sdk, documentations.
In the future, I will also add popular software technologies. If a technology is not available yet,
I put a article teasing it. I also added good ux tutorials about AR/VR/MR.

> If you find this list is not up to date, do not hesitate to propose a technology yourself using [github issues](https://github.com/friedrith/ux-research/issues).
