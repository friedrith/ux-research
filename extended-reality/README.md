# Extended Reality

As of March 1, 2018, I am currently working on virtual reality, augmented and mixed reality.

> You can find links about VR/AR technologies found during my projects [here](technologies.md).

## HUDs

My first project is about HUDs to see if HUDs like in science-fiction would be efficient in real life.

The hypothesis is: **high detailed HUDs can increase efficiency.**

The whole goal of this project will be validate or invalidate this hypothesis.

The research protocol will be:

* a state of the art study
* a science-fiction movies/novels analyze
* several intermediate questions

## Science-fiction analyze

In user experience research, science-fiction has always been a source of inspiration.
