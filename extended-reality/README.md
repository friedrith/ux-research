# Extended Reality

As of March 1, 2018, I am currently working on virtual reality, augmented and mixed reality.

## Virtual reality

Innovative user interfaces like virtual reality are fashionable in 2018. But before to put in place
the necessary means in the companies to integrate this kind of technology in grand public products,
it is important to analyze if virtual reality brings something more for the users.

In virtual reality, there is the term reality. It means that it is built to explore a reality, a world
in three dimensions. So we need to check if virtual reality is really more efficient thant the best
current user interfaces to explore 3D worlds: flat screens and current reality.

### Virtual reality vs flat screens

First of all, we can compare virtual reality with 2D screens. Exploring 3D worlds with 2D screens at
the first person may seem awkward but it is very popular in video gaming since 80s with first person
shooter games like [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).

A lot of competitive games (CS-GO, Call of Duty) are now available and so users have been more and
more efficient to explore 3D worlds with a flat screens. So using a flat screen stay relevant even
to explore a world in three dimensions. After a first look, we can find three reasons why VR might
be more efficient than current 2D screens.

The first reason is the **angle of vision**. Since the reality virtual is supposed to reproduce
the user vision, it should have a peripheral vision than 2D screens. And with a better angle of
vision, virtual reality should help user to see things around him.

The second reason is the **non hand-eye coordination**. With video games displayed in flat screens
you always have the direction of the hand synchronized with the direction of yours eyes. It means that
you cannot interact with something which is not in your angle of vision. It is not very significant in
video games because the game play is adapted to this constraint. However it might be more problematic
in some other use cases.

The third reason is more anecdotal. It is the **similarity of movements between virtual reality and
reality**. In flat screens, the movements of the head is controlled by the mouse, joysticks and keyboard.
It may be very accurate for trained people. However it may also be disturbing for non aware users.
In this case, virtual reality may be easier to use for these non aware users.

These three reasons might be the reasons to use a VR headset instead of a standard flat screens even
at work in order to improve your productivity. However, we need to validate these reasons.
