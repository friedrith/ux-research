# Extended Reality

As of March 1, 2018, I am currently working on virtual reality, augmented and mixed reality.

> You can find links about VR/AR technologies found during my projects [here](technologies.md).

Innovative user interfaces like VR or AR are fashionable in 2018. But before to put in place
the necessary means in the companies to integrate this kind of technology in grand public products,
it is important to analyze if it brings something useful for the users in comparison of
current standard technologies.

> Notice that, in all these projects, I am focus on productivity at work and daily life. I love video
games but I am more interested in finding a way to help more people than only games.
