# HUDs

My first project is about HUDs to see if HUDs like in science-fiction would be efficient in real life.

The hypothesis is: **Detailed HUDs can increase efficiency.**

The whole goal of this project will be validate or invalidate this hypothesis. In fact the answer
may be not totally binary and the purpose will be to find how to optimize the HUDs to make them as
efficient as possible.

## Introduction

The research protocol will be:

* general state of the art study
* general list of the science-fiction movies/novels using HUDs
* redefinition of the context and the research target
* iterative study
  * definition of the hypothesis
  * state of the art study
  * definition of the case study
  * definition of success criteria
  * prototyping
  * evaluation

## Global state of the art

* [HUD challenge in 2018 organized by the US governement](https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/funding-opportunities/prizes-challenges/2018-virtual-reality-heads-display-navigation)
* [HUD driving car simulator (2013)](https://www.gcu.ac.uk/media/gcalwebv2/business/Virtual%20Driving%20Simulator.pdf)
* [TSSG laboratory](https://www.tssg.org/research/units/ar-vr/arvr-research-themes/)
* [VR to train drill workers in mining industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095268617303439)
* [Comparison between several VR platforms/support](http://www.indjst.org/index.php/indjst/article/viewFile/97234/71205)
* [HUD for vehicles](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262635892_Human_Machine_Interface_for_Prototype_Head_Up_Display_Comparative_study_between_2D_and_VR_Simulation_Results)

> Conclusion: Most of research studies on VR deals only with the capacity of the user to see the display
without more questions about the ergonomy. Several of them discuss about the angle of vision. Few others
talk about the HUD in vehicle.

## Science-fiction analyze

In user experience research, science-fiction has always been a source of inspiration. So it may be
very useful to find

### Movies

* Iron Man ([Iron man case study](https://scifiinterfaces.com/2015/07/01/iron-man-hud-a-breakdown/))
* Oblivion
* The 5th element
* Robocop
* https://scifiinterfaces.com/tag/hud/

* [HUD in movies](https://www.hudsandguis.com/)
* [Build HUD for movie](http://jayse.tv/v2/?portfolio=hud)

### Novels

* The Expanse (mars marines)

## Redefinition of the context

**Head Up Display** describes various display devices.
In this project, we will focus on HUDs fixed from a user point of view called Head Mounted Display (HMD).
It gathers glasses (like Intel's Vaunt), contact lens, headsets (like Hololens or HTC Vive) and
helmets. But it excludes driving HUDs projected on the windshield for example.

This project will be focused on HUD for hight productivity at work or event in daily life but not for
gaming.
