## State of the art

* VR
* angle of vision
* not about ergonomy in HMD (vehicle yes)
* difference between reality and virtuality

However VR/AR needs to be very ergonomic

## redefinition of the context

* HMD
* scenario


## Subquestions

* is HUD visible (top, bottom, left, right)?
* is it possible to see the HUD and the reality in the same time ? (attention)
* what is the maximum quantity of piece of information displayable on the HUD ?
* what mechanism may be used to optimize the quantity of information displayed (modes, detection the eye direction, virtual assistant, vocal) ?

HUDs vs simple dashboards vs (menu on the arm ?)


## Prototyping & tests

* a virtual world controllable from another PC, visible from another PC.
