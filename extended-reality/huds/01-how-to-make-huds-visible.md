# How to make HUDs visible ?

This first step is to create a first version of the HUD using basic web technologies, google
cardboard and One Plus 5.

## Virtual world

First of all, we create a virtual world where we move in using cardboards.





In order to benchmark the HUD visibility, we will begin to place Ui elements on the top left, top right,
bottom left and bottom right of the user's field of vision.

Google Cardboard don't have a very large vision field in comparison of real vision field so we can
put the element at the maximum top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right.
